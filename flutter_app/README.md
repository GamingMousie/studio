# ShipShape Flutter

This directory contains a very small Flutter prototype of the ShipShape warehouse management app. It demonstrates how the original Next.js project could be reimplemented in Dart/Flutter.

Currently it includes:

- Basic data models for trailers and shipments in `lib/models/`.
- Sample data in `lib/data/initial_data.dart`.
- A simple home screen listing trailers (`lib/main.dart`).

This is **not** a complete port of the React application, but a starting point that shows how the project structure could look in Flutter.
