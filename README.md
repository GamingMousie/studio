# Firebase Studio

This repository contains a Next.js demo application called **ShipShape**. The client-side app is built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

The original entry point is `src/app/page.tsx`.

An overview of the codebase structure and key concepts is provided in
[`docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md).

## Flutter prototype

A minimal Flutter rewrite is included in [`flutter_app/`](flutter_app/). It contains basic models and a simple page listing trailers. This serves as a starting point for porting the project to Dart/Flutter.
